This is a brief description of how the process works:

First, download autodock vina, and adtools. 

vina: http://vina.scripps.edu
adtools: http://autodock.scripps.edu/resources/adt

step 0 - make pdbqt file of ligand, starting from the pdb file (this can be done with adtwools).  
Run make_ligand_pdbqt. THis puts pdbqt file into pdbqt.ligand

step 1 - get snapshots of the protein from simulations trajectory, using get_frames_for_pdbqt.tcl, then fix using 'set.element.tcl'.

step 2 - make receptor pdbqts using 'make_receptor_pdbqt'.  this step takes a while, you can start creating a small number of frames just to get an idea of how it works.

step 3 - make conf files for autodock vina, using 'make_confs' scripts. you will need to change the name of ligand to match whatever your ligand pdbqt is called.

step 4 - run docking using autodick vina - the main line is :

	path_to_autodock_vina/vina --config conf.files/$JOBNAME.conf --cpu $NCPUS
	Just run run_docking.sh and this should be taken care of

step 5 - get ligand binding poses from the generated log files using 'get_pdb_from_dlg', this will generated pdbs that can be visualized in vmd!

step 6 - merge protein and ligand together using merging_poses.tcl

step 7 - load merged files to vmd using vmdload.tcl

step 8 - optionally, after loading in vmd, create a js file with all docked poses... this should decrease the time it takes to load.

step 9 - save list of energies using get_energies.sh
